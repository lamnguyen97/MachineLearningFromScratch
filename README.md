# MachineLearningFromScratch
- Some basic Supervised and Unsupervised learning algorithms that implemented by me from scratch

## Supervised Learning
- Regression: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression
- Classification: Perceptron Learning, Multilayer Perceptron, SVM

## Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering: K-mean, KNN
- Dimensions reduction: LDA, PCA

## Statistical Learning
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Hidden Markov Model
